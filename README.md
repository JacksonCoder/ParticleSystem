# ParticleSystem
A basic SFML particle system.
Makefile coming soon! (If you want to compile this on your own, make sure you have the SFML frameworks installed)
An xcode project file is provided in case you want to use XCode.

If you aren't using a mac, you can just take the JParticle files and use them in your project (make sure you are using the SFML frameworks)
Documentation coming soon!
