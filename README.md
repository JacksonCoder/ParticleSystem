# ParticleSystem
A basic SFML particle system.
Makefile coming soon! (If you want to compile this on your own, make sure you have the SFML frameworks installed)
An xcode project file is provided in case you want to use XCode.

If you just want to use the Particle files, just add the Particle.cpp and Particle.hpp files in your project (make sure you are using the SFML frameworks)
Documentation coming soon!
